# FamilyMade

## Family is important!
Family is important and so is food.<br>
We all know family search as one of the best tools to bring families together.<br>
Do you know what else brings family together? FOOD!<br>

## Design
This web app will allow you to create a group or family that can share food recipies, pictures, and ratings. It is designed so that old recipies can be kept for generations and those who made them remebered.<br>
Users are going to be able to send messages within the app and connect with far away members.


Bring to life your familyâ€™s history by exploring the food of those that came before you!

## Technologies
### 1. HTML
It structures the content on the service, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.<br>
I added, in the html startup assignment, the basic skeleton for the service. All pages that will need to be accessed are there (a landing page, login/create account, main page, chats, groups, profile, and notifications).

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS will be used for styling the web pages, controlling the layout, and enhancing the visual presentation of HTML elements.

### 3. JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to web pages. It runs in the browser and allows dynamic content updates, user interactions, and asynchronous communication. It will be used to control valid data and frontend logic.<br>
I have added several scripts to ensure log in, new account creation, backend database pull and fill data, and future websocket connections.

### 4. Backend
The backend involves server-side scripting, handling databases, and managing application logic. This load from the database, do validation on login.

### 5. Database
The database will store and manage data for the web application such as group information and recipies.

### 6. WebSocket
WebSockets provide a bidirectional communication channel between the client and server over a single, long-lived connection. This will serve the chat option on the application.
